## Contributing to ProactiveAgent

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes and update documentation when needed.
3. Ensure your code lints/formats locally (see `pyproject.toml` if tools are configured).
4. Open a pull request with a clear title and description.
5. Respond to review feedback and keep your branch up to date with `main`.

## Report bugs using GitHub issues
Use issues to track public bugs and requests. Open a new issue here: [ProactiveAgent issues](https://github.com/leomariga/ProactiveAgent/issues).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great bug reports include:

- A quick summary and background
- Steps to reproduce (be specific!) with minimal sample code if possible
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (why this might be happening, things you tried)

## Use a consistent coding style
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow existing patterns and prefer clear, descriptive names
- Run configured linters/formatters before committing (see `pyproject.toml`)
- Add concise docstrings where helpful
